# 2. The fundamental problems of distribution

In this part we do not distinguish between file systems and databases.

Homegeneous (all run with the same sowftware / OS) vs. inhomogeneous (diff. software / OS).


## 


# 3. Distributing file systems

## Specific problems of distributed file systems

## An exemple of distributed file system: HDFS

![](../img/hadoop.png)

HDFS stands for "Hadoop Distributed File System."

It is an open-source project financed by tha Apache Fundation.

### Why HDFS?

### The architecture

### Role of the master (nodename)

### Role of the slaves

### Properties

How this specific architecture acheives fault-tolerance, etc.

## Other job-schedulers

# 4. Distributing databases

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database

## Specific problems of distributed databases

## An exemple of distributed database: ???????????


# 5. Distributing tasks

## Specific problems of distributed task management

vocabulary: job, task...

## An exemple of job-scheduler: YARN

### The architecture

### Role of the master (job scheduler)

### Role of the slaves

### Properties

How this specific architecture acheives fault-tolerance, etc.

## Other job-schedulers

### Python's Celery

# 5. Parallezing compution on distributed data

## Map-reduce principle

## Map-shuffle-reduce principle

## An exemple of parallelized computation framework: Spark

## Other frameworks

# 6. Statistical applications



# 7. Conclusions and perspectives

## What to remember from today?

## What to remember from the course?

Is big data a problem for you?
Is it worth it?

Key insights:
- use sampling
- maybe you can afford waiting
- beware of the cost
- low level is faster
- think befor you do

## Now you understand this:

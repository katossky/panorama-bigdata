# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore several ways to accelerate a slow statistical procedure.

We start with the following code. The procedure uses a database of monthly declaration by air carriers operating in the US, the _Air Carrier Statistics_ database, also known as the *T-100 data bank*. You do not need to bother dowloading the sources, but you will find additionnal information at this link: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=111.

Considering that each observation in this database is a flight (it is not _exactly_ the case, but it does not matter here), the overall goal of the script is to compute :

- the overall number of flights per month
- the average number of passengers with a moving-window of 5, then 10 days
- a rolling-regression, explaining payload with seats, passengers, freight, mail, distance

_**Disclaimer:** the original data have been altered for the purpose of the tutorial ; specifically, a day variable has been created *ex nihilo*._

# 1. The procedure to optimize

## 1.a Libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(RPostgreSQL)
```


## 1.b Open a connection with the databse

```{r}
pw <- "YojCqLr3Cnlw6onuzHU3" # Do not change the password !

drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL") # loads the PostgreSQL driver.
                              # (Needed to query the data)

# This is the proper connection.
# The same object will be used each time we want to connect to the database.
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "postgres",
                 host = "database-1.c5bqsgv9tnea.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = pw)

rm(pw) # We don't need the password anymore.

dbExistsTable(con, "flight") # Check whether the "flight" table exist.
```

## 1.c Collect actual data set

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
FLIGHTS <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM flight LIMIT 2000")
FLIGHTS <- as_tibble(FLIGHTS)
FLIGHTS
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Query all the data of the flight database
FLIGHTS <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM flight")
FLIGHTS
```

## 1.d Flight number per month

```{r}
COUNTS <- data.frame(
  year  = integer(),
  month = integer(), 
  count = integer()
)

n <- 0

for (i in 1:nrow(FLIGHTS)) {
  
  flight    <- FLIGHTS[i,]
  selection <- COUNTS$year == flight$year & COUNTS$month == flight$month
  
  if(nrow(COUNTS[selection,]) > 0) {
    
    COUNTS[selection, "count"] <- COUNTS[selection, "count"]+1
    
  }else{
    
    n <- n+1
    
    COUNTS[n, "year"]  <- flight$year
    COUNTS[n, "month"] <- flight$month
    COUNTS[n, "count"] <- 1
  }
}
```

```{r}
COUNTS # just a sample is shown
```

## 1.e Rolling average of the number of passengers, with a window of 5 and 10 days

```{r}
PASSENGERS_adjusted <- tibble()

# Passengers per day
PASSENGERS <- FLIGHTS %>% 
  group_by (year, month, day) %>%
  summarise (passengers = sum(passengers)) %>%
  arrange(year, month, day)

# 5-days rolling average. Begins at day 5.
for (i in 5:nrow(PASSENGERS)) {
  
  n <- 0
  for(j in (i-4):i) n <- n + PASSENGERS$passengers[j]
  
  new_row <- tibble(
    year          = PASSENGERS$year[i],
    month         = PASSENGERS$month[i],
    day           = PASSENGERS$day[i],
    passengers    = PASSENGERS$passengers[i],
    passengers_w5 = n/5
  )
  
  PASSENGERS_adjusted <- bind_rows(PASSENGERS_adjusted, new_row)
}

# 10-days rolling average. Begins at day 10.
for (i in 10:nrow(PASSENGERS)) {
  
  n <- 0
  for(j in (i-9):i) n <- n + PASSENGERS$passengers[j]
  
  PASSENGERS_adjusted[i-5, "passengers_w10"] <- n/10
}
```

```{r}
PASSENGERS_adjusted
```

## 1.f Rolling regression

A rolling regression is just a regression smoothed over time, exactly as the moving average is a smoothed version of the average. The regression is done on a moving windows of 1000 flights.

This regression explores the relationship between the payload on one hand, and on ther other hand number of seats, the mumber of transported passengers, the quantity of freight and mail transported and the flight distance.

_**Disclaimer:** do not try to make too much sense of this regression. We came short of a better exemple with the correct complexity balance._

```{r}

variables <- c("seats", "passengers", "freight", "mail", "distance")
betas     <- numeric()
FLIGHTS   <- FLIGHTS %>% arrange(year, month, day)

for (i in 1000:nrow(FLIGHTS)) {
  X <- data.matrix(FLIGHTS[(i-999):i, variables])
  X <- cbind(intercept=1, X)
  Y <- matrix(FLIGHTS$payload[(i-999):i], nrow = 1000, ncol = 1)
  betas <- cbind(betas, solve(t(X)%*% X) %*% t(X) %*% Y)
}
rownames(betas) <- c("intercept", "seats", "passengers", "freight", "mail", "distance")
betas[,1:10]
```

# 2. Execution

2.1. Run the code.

2.2. Does it take time ? Any idea why ?

2.3. Find a way to make it run quickly

# 3. Time-complexity and profiling

Now that the code is running, we will try to find how much time each part takes and prioritize our work.

3.1. Factorize the procedure into four functions, that each depends on the input size.

3.2. What is the empirical time complexity of each part ? Is it linear? Produce a time vs. input size plot to help you. _Just focus on a couple of values at the beginning of the input-size range. You may use the `microbenchmark` package or any similar packages._

3.3. What is the memory complexity of each part ? Is it linear? Produce a max-memory used vs. input size plot. _You may use the `profmem()` function from the `profmem` package._

3.4. You can perform all that in one step with R-Studio (Profile > Start profiling), the advantage beeing that you get the internal details of each execution.

3.5. What are the parts you would optimize in priority ?

You will find resources about profiling in R and R-Studio here:

# 4. Data-transfer optimisation

4.1. In the SQL querry, do we really need to do the following?

```{SQL, eval=FALSE}
 SELECT * FROM flight
```

4.2. Can we transfer some treatments done in R to the database ? If so, update the code. *Google is your friend!*

4.3. Let's focus on the total number of flights by month.
  
  a. Can you optimmize the computation with (faster) R statements? Compare as many solutions as you can think of with `bench::mark()`.
  b. Can you perform the computation with SQL statements?
  c. Which is faster ? (including data fetch)

# 5. R-code optimisation

5.1 With `bench::mark()`, compare `v <- cumprod(1:n)` and `v<-1; for(i in 2:n) v[i] <- v[i-1]*i ; v`. Which is faster? Can you spot similar (un)vectorised patterns in our code?

5.2 With `bench::mark()`, compare `v <- rep(1,n)`, `v <- numeric() ; for(i in 1:n) v[i] <- 1 ; v` and `v <- numeric() ; for(i in 1:n) v <- c(1,v)`. Can you spot similar assignment patterns in our code?

# 6. Algorithmic optimisation

6.1. Think about how rolling averages work. Are we not performing just 5 times or 10 times the computations needed? How can you change the code to optimize it ?

6.2. Why is it a bad idea to recode the linear regression? Using `bench::mark()` compare our regression estimates with `lm()`. Why is it so much faster? _You may want to inspect the code, the real code is really short, most of if is just tests and warnings!_ <!-- lm.fit calls a QR decomposition in C, z <- .Call(C_Cdqrls, x, y, tol, FALSE) ; I don't think QR decomposition is particularly faster than matrix inversion — however, it is numerically much more stable! ; and C code is much faster than R code. -->

You will find here the algorithmic complexity of many common mathematical operations:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations

# 7. Parallelisation

7.1. Do the regressions depend of each other ? Thus, suggest a way to accelerate this part of the procedure.

7.2 You may use the `doParallel` package to declare and use more than one core. A typical exemples runs like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(foreach)               # Parallel for loops
library(parallel)              # Interface between R and multiple cores
library(doParallel)            # Interface between foreach and parallel
detectCores()                  # How many cores are available ?
registerDoParallel(cores=2)    # Number of cores you want to work with
foreach(i=1:10) %dopar% function(i) # Parallel for loop
```

Try to increase one by one the number of cores. Plot the number of cores vs. time. Is the speed-up proportionnal to the number of cores?

7.2 One regression is basically a bunch of matrix operations. How can we theoretically speed that up? <!-- by performing computation on GPU -->

# 8. Sampling

We do not need to perform the actual complete computation if we are ready to accept some imprecision. But there is a trade-off between computation-time and precision. **For simplification of the problem, let's assume we are only interested with the average number of passenger per flight.**

Let's assume that a sample is taken from a (potentially infinite) population with a (known or knowable) data-generating process. An approach to the measure of uncertainty is **asymptotical inference**.

8.1. In this context, recall the asymptotical distribution of the mean estimator of a random sample of size $n$, as n tends to infinity. How can you estimate the distribution? <!-- you need an estimation of the variance -->

8.2. Modify the database request, so that it returns a _random_ sample of size $n$. You may try first with $n=40$ then wrap your code in a function for arbitrary $n$. <!-- ORDER BY random() LIMIT 40 -->

8.3 On the same graph, draw violin plots of the estimated distribution for sub-samples of size $40 \times 2^k$ for $k=1,...,10$ from the downloaded sample. You may want to complete the following code.
    
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tictoc)

x         <- mean(FLIGHTS$passengers) + seq(-200, 200, by=10)
probs     <- tibble() # an empty data frame with dplyr package
estimates <- tibble()

for(k in 1:10){

  n <- 40*2^k
  
  tic()
  m_hat <- .............. # mean
  s_hat <- .............. # standard deviation
  t <- toc()
  
  
  estimates[k, "n"] <- n
  estimates[k, "m"] <- m_hat
  estimates[k, "s"] <- s_hat
  estimates[k, "t"] <- t$toc - t$tic
  
  probs[k,"x"] <- x
  probs[k,"f"] <- dnorm(x,m_hat,s_hat)
  probs[k,"k"] <- k
  
}

probs %>% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=f, group=k, color=k)) + geom_violin() + guides(color="none")
```

8.4. Make a plot of $\hat{\sigma}$ against computation time. What would be an acceptable level of precision here?

8.5. In case of more complex estimators (such as a rolling average, or rolling regression) the derivation of confidence bounds is not as straightforward. What else can be used? Could it be computed efficiently? <!-- bootstrap ; it is an embarassingly parallel problem and can thus be parallelized -->

# 9 Scaling up: a bigger machine

Create a powerful EC2 instance to run you code (like a m5.2xlarge with 8 cores and 32 GB or Ram) to run your code and see if there is a big difference. To do this you have to

9.1. Create an EC2 instance with ubuntu on it

9.2. Authorize SSH connection to the instance (see : "Etablir une connexion SSH avec votre cluster" in the previous session)

9.3. Connect with SSH with a SSH tunnel from port 8157

9.4. Install and configure foxyproxy (see : "Installer FoxyProxy" in the previous session. It seems that foxyproxy doesn't work well with chrome, please use Firefox)

9.5. Install Rstudio server

```bash
# Install R
sudo apt-get install r-base
# To install local package
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
# Donwload Rstudio server
wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/trusty/amd64/rstudio-server-1.2.5033-amd64.deb
# Install it
sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.2.5033-amd64.deb
```

9.6. Create a Rstudio user

```bash
# Make User
sudo useradd -m rstudio-user
sudo passwd rstudio-user
```

9.7. Connect to Rstudio server : https://[public-DNS]:8787 with [public-DNS] the public DNS of the instance

You will find all the steps and explanation in the previous practical session. The main differences are :

- you don't create an EMR cluster, just an EC2 instance
- you have to connect to the EC2 instance with it DNS public address

# 10 Scaling out: more machines

Create a spark cluster, install Rstudio-server on it (see TP 0) and update the code to use spark function. Run the code.

## A quick history of IT hardware in enterprise

.pull-left[
- 1940 - mid 1960 : Mainframe era
  - Commercial, scientific, and large-scale computing only.
  - Only big enterprise can buy mainframes.
  - No direct user interaction (scren, keyboard), but card punches
  - Data and computing are centralised

## A quick history of IT hardware in enterprise

.pull-left[
- mid 1960 - mid-1990 : Fat client era.
  - Developement of micro-computing, personnal computers become cheaper and cheaper
  - Instead of one mainframe for data and computing, one server is for the data, and computation are executed on personnal computer (**fat client**)
  - Fat client are autonomous of each other. They need the data server only to download the data

## A quick history of IT hardware in enterprise

.pull-left[
- mid-1990 - 2010 : In-house datacenter era.
  - mid 1990 : democratization of the Internet
  - Communication speed increase quickly
  - Centralisation of data and computing in data datacenter.
  - Personnal computer for daily tasks (mail, office etc)
  - Server for computation

Note : You can go on step further, like at Ensai, and put everything in the server

## Cloud computing definition

Wikipedia : Cloud computing  is **Internet-based  computing**,  whereby **shared resources, software, and informationare** provided to computers and  other devices **on demand**, like the electricity  grid. Cloud computing  is a style of computing  in **which dynamically  scalable** and  often **virtualized  resources** are provided  as a **service** over the Internet.

--

In a nutshell :
- shared physical ressources (mutalization of cost) in remote location
- Access via the Internet
- On demand scalable services

---
## Why cloud computing ?

- The world is changing faster than ever

--
- Need quick reponse to new problem

--
- Building a new datacenter, buying new servers or create new architectures take too much time ! 

--
- The on demand nature of cloud computing make possible to create new services in no time

---
## Why cloud computing

- Less investment : don't have to buy anything, just pay for what you use
- Easy scalable : "just" pay for more ressources
- Flexible : create and delete ressource in no time
- No maintenance cost : it's the resposability of your cloud provider
- Reliable : it's the resposability of your cloud provider
- Innovation : new ressources are accessible in no time, and you pay for what you use.

---
## Different services

For example you want to have somewhere to sleep. You can

--

- Buy a site to build your house.

  -> But you have to keep everything in good condition all by yourself. Your investement is important, and before your house is built you can't sleep in your house.

--
- Rent a site to build a house. 

  -> Your landlord keep in good condition the site and you your home. Your investemet is lower but you still have to wait for your house.

--
- Rent an already built empty house. 

  -> Your landlord keep in good condition everything. You still have to buy a bed.

--
- Go to the hotel.

  -> You do not have to do anything BUT you control nothing

---
## Different services

For example you want to have somewhere to sleep. You can

- Buy a site to build your house **In house datacenter**.

High investement, but you have full control on your infrastructure.

--
- Rent a site to build a house. **Infrastrucre as a Service**. 

You pay for an infrastructure but you have to build up your own IT system. You have a full controll on what you do with your ressources.

--
- Rent an already built empty house. **Platform as a Service**. 

You pay for an already installed platform, you do not manage any lower level resource management and can develop you own IT system on it

--
- Go to the hotel. **Software as a Servce**. 

You directly use some existed IT solution. Little control on the software.

---
## Infrastrucre as a Service, IaaS

- Provide to the consumer
  - Processing capacity
  - Storage
  - Network
  - and other fundamental computing ressources
- The consumer do not manage physical infrastructure but has control over the provided ressources

- Exemples : Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud



---
## Platform as a Service, IaaS

- Provide to the consumer already configured infrascture to deploy it's own application
- The consumer do not manage physical infrastructure neither has control over the provided ressources
- The consumer control the deployed application

- Exemples : Amazon Relational Database Service, Amazon Elastic Map Reduce
---
## Software as a Service, SaaS
 

- Provide to the consumer the capability to use a running application manage by the cloud provider
- The consumer do not control anything, excepte some user-specific settings

- Exemples : all the Google Apps

---
## Some exemples of cloud computing : New York Times

- The need
  - conversion from TIFF to pdf of all articles from 1851 to 1922
  - 4TB of input (405,000 very large TIFF images, 3.3 million articles in SGML and 405,000 xml files mapping articles to rectangular regions in the TIFF’s)

--
- The realization
  - Run around 100 EC2 instances to create an Hadoop cluster for 24h (estimate cost 800$)
  - Realize they made a mistake
  - Rerun the cluster with the fix for 24h (estimate cost 800$)

--
- Conclusion
  - Convert to pdf 70 years of newspapers for less than 2000$ !

---
## Some exemples of cloud computing : Animoto

Animoto is a cloud-based video creation service (Saas)

- Start-up without any physical server
- Rents servers (IaaS) to deploy its application
- Starts with 40 servers
- Scales up from 40 to 5000 servers in 4 days to meet the growing number of subscriber !

--
Cannot be done with on site datacenter

---
## Some cloud providers

- Amazon web service
- Google cloud plateform
- Microsoft azure
- OVHcloud

---
## Cloud and ecology

- It's not because you don't own the server that the server does not pollute.
- The internet consume about 2% of the worldwide electricity.
- Theoretically, with the mutualization of ressource cloud computing could be greenner than in site datacenter
- But, because cloud computing become cheaper, more people use it, and are less carful with the cost. So more servers are running, maybe over dimensionned one, and cloud computing can me more polluting than old school datacente.
- No real evidence of that.
